# pipeband-music
Collection of lilypond files for a pipeband.

It concerns bagpipes and three types of drums (bass, tenor and snare (or side)).
To this end, you will need the bagpipe.ly normally included by lilypond aswell as the lilydrum package ([lyp-package](https://github.com/lyp-packages/lilydrum/) / [git](https://github.com/kastdeur/lilydrum)).

For most tunes there are at least pipe and snare scores + a 'full' score containing both.
If we play our standards for a tune, it is not included.
The same holds for tenor and bass scores.

Although this is my personal collection, quite a few tunes are used for my pipeband [The Seaforth Highlanders of Holland Memorial Pipes and Drums](https://seaforth.nl).
