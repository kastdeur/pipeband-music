# pipeband-drumming
First trial with github, purpose is to set up a lilypond file in the same way as there is a bagpipe.ly (see github.com/svenax/bagpipemusic). Main focus is on pipeband snare drumming. Note that it would be best if they are compatible to create fullscores (see fullscore/ folder for first set up of Black Bear)

Somehow, the drums part in lilypond does not cover a notation with only right left. That is right is above the line and left is below it. In the same manner as the bagpipe.ly file, flams and drags are defined as a shortcut.

There has been a lilypond include file earlier made by Simon Froger (which includes all of the above). So first version is a shameless copy.
This is meant to extend or translate some parts.

The original file can still be found at http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Snippet?id=970


Currently, the most advanced scores are for Lady MacKenzie of Fairburn in strathspeys/lady_mackenzie_of_fairburn/*.ly
These scores are used for most of the layout.
The scores include a side, tenor, bass, pipes, fullscore for drums and a regular fullscore.
