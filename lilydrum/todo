 * show 8th and 16th beats in beaming, currently only 8ths:  d32[[ g] d[ g]] d32[[ g] d[ g]]
 * Macro for tutti's (unisons)
	- on just one note
	- with open ending
 * Macro for "Part 2 of $n"
 * If 8/16/32/..th notes come before a flam, they have a flag instead of a beam (fixable by explicit beaming, but rather have a good autobeaming)
 * A tuplet beginning with a flam has a strange tuplet beam (slanted) (fixable by putting the flam outside of the tuplet .. However the flam function doesnt work that way (yet))
 * It's customary to have 4 bars per line for portrait and 8 for landscape...

 * SIDE sticking
	rimshot				default + cross

 * FLOURISHING			short	long			note	above-note
	ups					\up								arrow-up
	scoop				\scoop							arrow-right-(diag-up then diag-down) [propably start on beginning of note and filter out the last one]
